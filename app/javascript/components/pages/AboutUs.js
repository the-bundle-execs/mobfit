         <p>
         At MobFit, we believe there's a better way to utilize public spaces. A more valuable, less invasive way
         where trainers and people can come together and break a sweat!

         The idea came to us in a collective dream.
         Gone are the days of watching those pesky kids using up all that space in the parks.
         Move over uncle Joes Yearly BBQ! We're coming in, and we want to sweat!! And some ribs.
